        <p><strong>Baby</strong> was my first pet, adopted during my college days. It was found in the mezzanine of the wall and was noticed by good people. Maybe it’s because of  wildness that she is very smart, and also very picky to accompany me from my student years to work for more than ten years, and she went to heaven this year.</p>
